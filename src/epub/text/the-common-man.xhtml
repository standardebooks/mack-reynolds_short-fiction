<h2><big>by Guy McCord</big></h2>
<p><b>Illustrated by Schelling</b></p>
<p class="fixer">Frederick Braun, M.D., Ph.D.,
various other Ds, pushed his slightly
crooked horn-rims back on his
nose and looked up at the two-story
wooden house. There was
a small lawn before it, moderately
cared for, and one tree. There was
the usual porch furniture, and the
house was going to need painting
in another six months or so, but
not quite yet. There was a three-year-old
hover car parked at the
curb of a make that anywhere else
in the world but America would
have been thought ostentatious in
view of the seeming economic
status of the householder.</p>
<p>Frederick Braun looked down at
the paper in his hand, then up at
the house again. He said to his two
companions, "By Caesar, I will
admit it is the most average-looking
dwelling I have ever seen."</p>
<p>Patricia O'Gara said impatiently,
"Well, do we or don't we?" Her
hair should have been in a pony
tail, or bouncing on her shoulders,
or at least in the new Etruscan revival
style, not drawn back in its
efficient bun.</p>
<p>Ross Wooley was unhappy. He
scratched his fingers back through
his reddish crew cut. "This is
going to sound silly."</p>
<p>Patricia said testily, "We've been
through all that, Rossie, good
heavens."</p>
<p>"Nothing ventured, nothing ..."
Braun let the sentence
dribble away as he stuffed the paper
into a coat pocket, which had
obviously been used as a waste
receptacle for many a year, and led
the way up the cement walk, his
younger companions immediately
behind.</p>
<p>He put his finger on the doorbell
and cocked his head to one side.
There was no sound from the
depths of the house. Dr. Braun
muttered, "Bell out of order."</p>
<p>"It would be," Ross chuckled
sourly. "Remember? Average.
Here, let me." He rapped briskly
on the wooden door jamb. They
stood for a moment then he
knocked again, louder, saying almost
as though hopefully, "Maybe
there's nobody home."</p>
<p>"All right, all right, take it
easy," a voice growled even as the
door opened.</p>
<p>He was somewhere in his thirties,
easygoing of face, brownish of
hair, bluish of eye and moderately
good-looking. His posture wasn't
the best and he had a slight tummy
but he was a goodish masculine
specimen by Mid-Western standards.
He stared out at them, defensive
now that it was obvious they
were strangers. Were they selling
something, or in what other manner
were they attempting to intrude
on his well being? His eyes went
from the older man's thin face, to
the football hero heft of the
younger, then to Patricia O'Gara.
His eyes went up and down her
figure and became approving in
spite of the straight business suit
she affected.</p>
<p>He said, "What could I do for
you?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Crowley?" Ross said.</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"I'm Ross Wooley and my friends
are Patricia O'Gara and Dr. Frederick
Braun. We'd like to talk to
you."</p>
<p>"There's nobody sick here."</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently, "Of
course not. Dr. Braun isn't a practicing
medical doctor. We are research
biochemists."</p>
<p>"We're scientists," Ross told
him, putting it on what he assumed
was the man's level. "There's
something on which you could
help us."</p>
<p>Crowley took his eyes from the
girl and scowled at Ross. "Me?
Scientists? I'm just a country boy,
I don't know anything about
science." There was a grudging
self-deprecation in his tone.</p>
<p>Patricia took over, a miracle
smile overwhelming her air of
briskness. "We'd appreciate the
opportunity to discuss it with
you."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun added the clincher.
"And it might be remunerative."</p>
<p>Crowley opened the door wider.
"Well, just so it don't cost me
nothing." He stepped back for
them. "Don't mind the place. Kind
of mussed up. Fact is, the wife left
me about a week ago and I haven't
got around to getting somebody to
come in and kind of clean things
up."</p>
<p>He wasn't exaggerating. Patricia
O'Gara had no pretensions to the
housewife's art herself, but she
sniffed when she saw the condition
of the living room. There was a
dirty shirt drooped over the sofa
back and beside the chair which
faced the TV set were half a dozen
empty beer cans. The ashtrays
hadn't been emptied for at least
days and the floor had obviously
not been swept since the domestic
tragedy which had sent Mrs. Crowley
packing.</p>
<p>Now that the three strangers
were within his castle, Crowley's
instincts for hospitality asserted
themselves. He said, "Make yourself
comfortable. Here, wait'll I
get these things out of the way.
Anybody like a drink? I got some
beer in the box, or," he smirked at
Patricia, "I got some port wine
you might like, not this bellywash
you buy by the gallon."</p>
<p>They declined the refreshments,
it wasn't quite noon.</p>
<p>Crowley wrestled the chair
which had been before the TV set
around so that he could sit facing
them, and then sat himself down.
He didn't get this and his face
showed it.</p>
<p>Frederick Braun came to the
point. "Mr. Crowley," he said,
"did it ever occur to you that
somewhere amidst our nearly one
hundred million American males
there is the average man?"</p>
<p>Crowley looked at him.</p>
<p>Braun cleared his throat and with
his thumb and forefinger pushed
his glasses more firmly on the
bridge of his nose. "I suppose that
isn't exactly the technical way in
which to put it."</p>
<p>Ross Wooley shifted his football
shoulders and leaned forward earnestly.
"No, Doctor, that's exactly
the way to put it." He said to
Crowley, very seriously, "We've
done this most efficiently. We've
gone through absolute piles of
statistics. We've...."</p>
<p>"Done what?" Crowley all but
wailed. "Take it easy, will you?
What are you all talking about?"</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently, "Mr.
Crowley, you are the average
American. The man on the street.
The Common Man."</p>
<p>He frowned at her. "What'd'ya
mean, common? I'm as good as
anybody else."</p>
<p>"That's exactly what we mean,"
Ross said placatingly. "You are
exactly as good as anybody else,
Mr. Crowley. You're the average
man."</p>
<p>"I don't know what the devil
you're talking about. Pardon my
language, Miss."</p>
<p>"Not at all," Patricia sighed.
"Dr. Braun, why don't you take
over? We seem to all be speaking at
once."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>The little doctor began to enumerate
on his fingers. "The center of
population has shifted to this
vicinity, so the average American
lives here in the Middle West.
Population is also shifting from
rural to urban, so the average man
lives in a city of approximately this
size. Determining average age,
height, weight is simple with
government data as complete as
they are. Also racial background.
You, Mr. Crowley, are predominately
English, German and Irish,
but have traces of two or three
other nationalities."</p>
<p>Crowley was staring at him.
"How in the devil did you know
that?"</p>
<p>Ross said wearily, "We've gone
to a lot of trouble."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun hustled on. "You've
had the average amount of education,
didn't quite finish high
school. You make average wages
working in a factory as a clerk.
You spent some time in the army
but never saw combat. You drink
moderately, are married and have
one child, which is average for
your age. Your I.Q. is exactly
average and you vote Democrat
except occasionally when you
switch over to Republican."</p>
<p>"Now wait a minute," Crowley
protested. "You mean I'm the only
man in this whole country that's
like me? I mean, you mean I'm the
average guy, right in the middle?"</p>
<p>Patricia O'Gara said impatiently.
"You are the nearest thing to it,
Mr. Crowley. Actually, possibly
one of a hundred persons would
have served our purpose."</p>
<p>"O.K.," Crowley interrupted,
holding up a hand. "That gets us
to the point. What's this here purpose?
What's the big idea prying,
like, into my affairs till you learned
all this about me? And what's this
stuff about me getting something
out of it? Right now I'm between
jobs."</p>
<p>The doctor pushed his battered
horn-rims back on his nose with his
forefinger. "Yes, of course," he
said reasonably. "Now we get to
the point. Mr. Crowley, how
would you like to be invisible?"</p>
<p>The three of them looked at him.
It seemed to be his turn.</p>
<p>Crowley got up and walked into
the kitchen. He came back in a
moment with an opened can of beer
from which he was gulping even
as he walked. He took the can
away from his mouth and said carefully,
"You mean like a ghost?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not," Braun said
in irritation. "By Caesar, man,
have you no imagination? Can't
you see it was only a matter of time
before someone, possibly working
away on an entirely different subject
of research, stumbled upon
a practical method of achieving
invisibility?"</p>
<p>"Now, wait a minute," Crowley
said, his voice belligerent. "I'm
only a country boy, maybe, without
any egghead background, but
I'm just as good as the next man and
just as smart. I don't think I like
your altitude."</p>
<p>"Attitude," Ross Wooley muttered
unhappily. He shot a glance
at Patricia O'Gara but she ignored
him.</p>
<p>Patricia turned on the charm.
Her face opened into smile and she
said soothingly, "Don't misunderstand,
Mr. Crowley. May I call you
Don? I'm sure we're going to be
associates. You see, Don, we need
your assistance."</p>
<p>This was more like it. Crowley
sat down again and finished the
can of beer. "O.K., it won't hurt to
listen. What's the pitch?"</p>
<p>The older man cleared his throat.
"We'll cover it quickly so that we
can get to the immediate practical
aspects. Are you interested in biodynamics
... umah ... no, of
course not. Let me see. Are you at
all familiar with the laws pertaining
to refraction of ... umah,
no." He cleared his throat again,
unhappily. "Have you ever seen
a medusa, Mr. Crowley? The gelatinous
umbrella-shaped free swimming
form of marine invertebrate
related to the coral polyp and the
sea anemone?"</p>
<p>Ross Wooley scratched his crew
cut and grimaced. "Jellyfish, Doctor,
jellyfish. But I think the
Portuguese Man-of-War might be a
better example."</p>
<p>"Oh, jellyfish," Crowley said.
"Sure, I've seen jellyfish. I got an
aunt lives near Baltimore. We used
to go down there and swim in
Chesapeake Bay. Sting the devil
out of you. What about it?"</p>
<p>Patricia leaned forward, still
smiling graciously. "I really don't
see a great deal of point going into
theory, gentlemen." She looked at
Ross and Dr. Braun, then back at
Crowley. "Don, I think that what
the doctor was leading up to was
an attempt to describe in layman's
language the theory of the process
onto which we've stumbled. He
was using the jellyfish as an example
of a life form all but invisible.
But I'm sure you aren't interested
in technical terminology, are you?
A good deal of gobbledygook,
really, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's what I say. Let's
get to the point. You mean you
think it's possible to make a guy
invisible. Nobody could see him,
eh?"</p>
<p>"It's not a matter of thinking,"
Ross said sourly. "We've done it."</p>
<p>Crowley stared at him. "Done
it? You mean, you, personal? You
got invisible?"</p>
<p>"Yes. All three of us. Once
each."</p>
<p>"And you come back all right,
eh? So anybody can see you again."</p>
<p>The doctor said reasonably,
"Here we are, quite visible. The
effect of the usual dosage lasts for
approximately twelve hours."</p>
<p>They let him assimilate it for a
few minutes. Some of the ramifications
were coming home to him.
Finally he got up and went into the
back again for another can of beer.
By this time Ross Wooley was
wishing he would renew his offer,
but the other had forgotten his
duties as a host.</p>
<p>He took the can away from his
mouth and said, "You want to
make me invisible. You want me
to, like, kind of experiment on."
His eyes thinned. "Why pick me?"</p>
<p>The doctor said carefully, "Because
you're the common man, the
average man, Mr. Crowley. Before
we release this development, we
would like to have some idea of
the scope of the effects."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 191px;">
<img alt="" height="550" src="images/002.png" title="" width="191"/>
</div>
<p>The beer went down chuck-a-luck.
Crowley put the can aside and
licked his bottom lip, then rubbed
it with a fingertip. He said slowly,
"Now take it easy while I think
about this." He blinked. "Why you
could just walk into a bank and...."</p>
<p>The three were watching him,
empty-faced.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Dr. Braun said.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">Frederick Braun stared gloomily
from the hotel suite's window at
the street below. He peered absently
at his thin wrist, looked
blank for a moment, then realized
all over again that his watch was
being cleaned. He stared down at
the street once more, his wrinkled
face unhappy.</p>
<p>The door opened behind him and
Patricia O'Gara came in briskly
and said, "No sign of the guinea
pig yet, eh?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Where's Rossie?"</p>
<p>The doctor cleared his throat.
"There was an item on the newscast.
A humor bit. It seems that
the head waiter of the Gourmet....
Have you ever eaten at the
Gourmet, Patricia?"</p>
<p>"Do I look like a millionaire?"</p>
<p>"At any rate, a half pound of the
best Caspian caviar disappeared,
spoonful at a time, right before his
eyes."</p>
<p>Patricia looked at him. "Good
heavens."</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, Ross has gone to pay
the tab."</p>
<p>Patricia looked at her watch.
"The effects will be wearing off
shortly. Crowley will probably be
back at any time. We warned him
about returning to visibility in the
middle of some street, completely
nude." She sank into a seat and
looked up at the doctor. "I suppose
you admit I was right." Her voice
was crisp.</p>
<p>The other turned on her. "And
just why do you say that?"</p>
<p>"This caviar bit. Our friend,
Donald Crowley, has obviously
walked into the Gourmet restaurant,
having heard it was the most
expensive in New York, and ate
as much as he could stuff down of
the most expensive item on the
menu."</p>
<p>The elderly little doctor pushed
his battered horn-rims farther back
on his nose. "Tell me, Patricia,
when you made the experiment,
did you do anything ... umah
... anything at all, that saved
you some money?"</p>
<p>Uncharacteristically, she suddenly
giggled. "I had the time of
my life riding on a bus without
paying the fare."</p>
<p>Braun snorted. "Then Donald
Crowley, in eating his caviar, did
substantially the same thing. It's
probably been a life's ambition of
his to eat in an ultra-swank restaurant
and then walk out without
paying. To be frank," the doctor
cleared his throat apologetically,
"it's always been one of mine."</p>
<p>Patricia conceded him a chuckle,
but then said impatiently, "It's
one thing my saving fifteen cents
on a bus ride, and his eating
twenty-five dollars worth of
caviar."</p>
<p>"Merely a matter of degree, my
dear."</p>
<p>Patricia said in irritation, "Why
in the world did we have to bring
him to New York where he could
pull such childish tricks? We could
have performed the experiment
right there in Far Cry, Nebraska."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun abruptly ceased the
pacing he had begun and found a
chair. He absently stuck a hand
into a coat pocket, pulled out a
crumbled piece of paper, stared
at it for a moment, as though he
had never seen it before, grunted,
and returned it to the pocket. He
looked at Patricia O'Gara. "We
felt that on completely unknown
territory he would feel less constrained,
don't you remember? In
his home town, his conscience
would be more apt to restrict
him."</p>
<p>Something suddenly came to her.
She looked at her older companion
suspiciously. "That newscast. Was
there anything else on it? Don't
look innocent, you know what I
mean."</p>
<p>"Well, there was one item."</p>
<p>"Out with it," she demanded.</p>
<p>"The Hotel Belefonte threatens
to sue that French movie star,
Brigette whatever-her-name is."</p>
<p>"Brigette Loren," Patricia said,
staring. "What's that got to do
with Donald Crowley?"</p>
<p>The good doctor was embarrassed.
"It seems that she came
running out of her suite, umah,
semi-dressed and screaming that the
hotel was haunted."</p>
<p>"Good heavens," Patricia said
with sudden vision. "That's one
aspect I hadn't thought of."</p>
<p>"Evidently Crowley did."</p>
<p>Patricia O'Gara said definitely,
"My point's been proven. Our
average man is a slob. Give him
the opportunity to exercise unlimited
freedom without danger of
consequence and he becomes an
undisciplined and dangerous lout."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>Ross Wooley had come in, scowling,
just in time to catch most of
that. He tossed his hat onto a
table and fished in his pockets for
pipe and tobacco. "Nuts, Pat," he
said. "In fact, just the opposite's
been proven. Don's just on a fun
binge. Like a kid in a candy shop.
He hasn't done anything serious.
Went into a fancy restaurant and
ate some expensive food. Sneaked
into the hotel room of the world's
most famous sex-symbol and got a
close-up look." He grinned suddenly.
"I wish I had thought of
that."</p>
<p>"Ha!" Patricia snorted. "Our
engagement is off, you Peeping
Tom."</p>
<p>"Children, children," Braun
chuckled. "I'll admit, though, I
think Ross is correct. Don's done
little we three didn't when first
given the robe of invisibility. We
experimented, largely playfully,
even childishly."</p>
<p>Patricia bit out, "This experiment
is ridiculous, anyway, and I
don't know why I ever agreed to it.
Scientific? Nonsense. Where are our
controls? For it to make any sense
we'd have to work with scores of
subjects. Suppose we do agree that
the manner in which Don Crowley
has reacted is quite harmless. Does
that mean we can release this discovery
to the world? Certainly
not."</p>
<p>Ross said sullenly, "But you
agreed that we'd go by the results
of this...."</p>
<p>"I agreed to no such thing, Rossie
Wooley, you overgrown lug.
All I agreed to do was consider the
results. I was, and am, of the
opinion that if the person our
politicians so lovingly call the
Common Man was released of the
restrictions inhibiting him, he'd
go hog wild and destroy both
society and himself. What is to
prevent murder, robbery, rape and
a score of other crimes, given invisibility
for anyone who has a
couple of dollars with which to go
into a drugstore and purchase
our serum?"</p>
<p>Her fiancé sighed deeply, jamming
tobacco fiercely into the bowl
of his briar. He growled, "Look,
you seem to think that the only
thing that restricts man is the fear
of being punished. There are other
things, you know."</p>
<p>"Good heavens," she said sarcastically.
"Name <i>one</i>."</p>
<p>"There is the ethical code in
which he was raised, based on
religion or otherwise. There is
the fact that man is fundamentally
good, to use a trite term, given the
opportunity."</p>
<p>"My education has evidently
been neglected," Patricia said, still
argumentatively. "I've never seen
evidence to support your claim."</p>
<p>"I'm not saying individuals don't
react negatively, given opportunity
to be antisocial," he all but snarled.
"I'm just saying people in general,
common, little people, trend toward
decency, desire the right thing."</p>
<p>"Individuals my ... my neck,"
Patricia snapped back. "Did you
ever hear of Rome and the games?
Here a whole people, millions of
them, were given the opportunity
to indulge in sadistic spectacles to
their heart's desire. How many of
them stayed home from the
games?" She laughed in ridicule.</p>
<p>Ross flushed. "Some of them did,
confound it."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun had been taking in
their debate, uncomfortably. As
though in spite of himself, he said
now, "Very few, I am afraid."</p>
<p>"Religious ethic," Patricia pursued,
relentlessly. "The greatest
of the commandments is Thou
Shalt Not Kill, but comes along a
war in which killing becomes not
only permissible but an absolute
virtue and all our good Christians,
Jews, Mohammedans and even Buddhists,
who supposedly are not
even allowed to kill mosquitoes,
wade in with sheer happiness."</p>
<p>"War releases abnormal passions,"
Ross said grudgingly.</p>
<p>"You don't need a war. Look at
the Germans, supposedly one of our
most highly civilized people. When
the Nazi government released all
restraints on persecution of the
Jews, gypsies and others, you know
what happened. This began in
peace time, not in war."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun shifted in his chair. He
said, his voice low, "We needn't
look beyond our own borders. The
manner in which our people conducted
themselves against the
Amerinds from the very beginning
of the white occupation of North
America was quite shocking."</p>
<p>Ross said to him, "I thought you
were on my side. The Indian wars
were a long time ago. We're more
advanced now."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun said softly, "My
father fought against Geronimo
in Arizona. It wasn't so long ago
as all that."</p>
<p>Ross Wooley felt the argument
going against him and lashed back.
"We've been over and over this,
what's your point?"</p>
<p>Patricia said doggedly, "The
same point I tried to make from the
beginning. This discovery must
not be generally released. We'll
simply have to suppress it."</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">The door opened behind them.
They turned. Nothing was there.
Ross, scowling, lumbered to his
feet to walk over and close it.</p>
<p>"Hey, take it easy," a voice
laughed. "Don't walk right into
a guy."</p>
<p>Ross stopped, startled.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun and Patricia stood up
and stared, too.</p>
<p>Crowley laughed. "You all look
like you're seeing a ghost."</p>
<p>Ross rumbled a grudging
chuckle. "It'd be all right if we
<i>saw</i> the ghost, it's not seeing you
that's disconcerting."</p>
<p>The air began to shimmer, somewhat
like heat on the desert's face.</p>
<p>Crowley said, "Hey, the stuff's
wearing off. Where're my clothes?"</p>
<p>"Where you left them. There in
that bedroom," Ross said. "We'll
wait for you." He went back and
rejoined his associates. The door to
the bedroom opened, there was a
shimmering, more obvious now,
and then the door closed behind it.</p>
<p>"He rejoined us just in time,"
Dr. Braun murmured. "Another
ten minutes and he would have
... umah ... <i>materialized</i> down
on the street."</p>
<p>Ross hadn't finished the discussion.
He said, his face in all but
pout, "What you don't realize,
Pat, is the world has gone beyond
the point where scientific discoveries
can be suppressed. If we try to
keep the lid on this today, the Russians
or Chinese, or somebody, will
hit on it tomorrow."</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently, "Good
heavens, let's don't bring the Cold
War into it."</p>
<p>Ross opened his mouth to snap
something back at her, closed it
again and shrugged his bulky
shoulders angrily.</p>
<p>In a matter of less than ten
minutes the bedroom door reopened
and this time a grinning Crowley
emerged, fully dressed. He said,
"Man, that was a devil of an
experience!"</p>
<p>They saw him to a chair and
had him talk it all through. He was
candid enough, bubbling over with
it all.</p>
<p>In the some eleven and a half
hours he'd been on his own, he had
covered quite an area of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Evidently the first hour had been
spent in becoming used to the
startling situation. He couldn't
even see himself, which, to his surprise
affected walking and even use
of his hands. You had to get used
to it. Then there was the fact that
he was nude and <i>felt</i> nude and hence
uncomfortable walking about in
mixed pedestrian traffic. But that
phase passed. Early in the game he
found that there was small percentage
in getting into crowds. It
led to all sorts of complications,
including the starting of minor
rows, one person thinking another
was pushing when it was simply a
matter of Crowley trying to get
out from underfoot.</p>
<p>Then he went through a period
of the wonder of it all. Being able
to walk <i>anywhere</i> and observe people
who had no suspicion that they
were being observed. It was during
that phase that he had sought out
the hotel in which he had read the
chesty French movie actress Brigette
Loren was in residence. Evidently,
he'd hit the nail right on
the head. Brigette was at her
toilette when he arrived on scene.
In telling about this, Crowley
leered amusedly at Patricia from
the side of his eyes. She ignored
him.</p>
<p>Then he'd gone through a period
when the full realization of his
immunity had hit him.</p>
<p>At this point he turned to Braun,
"Hey, Doc, you ever eaten any
caviar? You know, that Russian
stuff. Supposed to be the most
expensive food in the world."</p>
<p>The doctor cleared his throat.
"Small amounts in hors d'oeuvres
at cocktail parties."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe I'm just a country
boy but the stuff tastes like fish
eggs to me. Anyway, to get back
to the story...."</p>
<p>He'd gone into Tiffany's and into
some of the other swank shops.
And then into a bank or two, and
stared at the treasures of Manhattan.</p>
<p>At this point he looked at Ross.
"You know, just being invisible
don't mean all that. How you going
to pick up a wad of thousand dollar
bills and just walk out the front
door with them? Everybody'd see
the dough just kind of floating
through the air."</p>
<p>"I came to the same conclusion
myself, when I experimented,"
Ross said wryly.</p>
<p>He had ridden on the subways
... free. He had eaten various
food in various swank restaurants.
He had even had drinks in name
bars, sampling everything from
Metaxa to vintage champagne. He
was of the opinion that even
though he remained invisible for
the rest of his years, he'd still stick
to bourbon and beer.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 385px;">
<img alt="" height="550" src="images/003.png" title="" width="385"/>
</div>
<p>He had gone down to Wall
Street and into the offices of the top
brokerage firms and into the sanctum
sanctorums of the wealthiest of
mucky-mucks but had been too
impatient to stick around long
enough to possibly hear something
that might be profitable. He admitted,
grudgingly, that he wouldn't
have known what to listen for
anyway. Frustrated there, he had
gone back uptown and finally
located the hangout of one of the
more renown sports promoters who
was rumored to have gangster connections
and was currently under
bail due to a boxing scandal. He
had stayed about that worthy's
office for an hour, gleaning nothing
more than several dirty jokes he'd
never heard before.</p>
<p>All this activity had wearied him
so he went to the Waldorf, located
an empty suite in the tower and
climbed into bed for a nap after
coolly phoning room service to
give him a call in two hours. That
had almost led to disaster. Evidently,
someone on room service
had found the suite to be supposedly
empty and had sent a boy
up to investigate. However, when
he had heard the door open, Crowley
had merely rolled out of the
bed and left, leaving a startled bellhop
behind staring at rumpled bedclothes
which had seemed to stir
of their own accord.</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>The rest of the day was little
different from the first hours. He
had gone about gawking in places
he couldn't have had he been visible.
Into the dressing room of
the Roxie, into the bars of swank
private clubs, into the offices of
the F.B.I. He would have liked
to have walked in on a poker game
with some real high rollers playing,
such as Nick the Greek, but he
didn't have the time nor know-how
to go about finding one.</p>
<p>Crowley wound it all up with a
gesture of both hands, palms upward.
"I gotta admit, it was fun,
but what the devil good is it?"</p>
<p>They looked at him questioningly.</p>
<p>Crowley said, "I mean, how's it
practical? How can you make a
buck out of it, if you turn it over
to the public, like? Everybody'd
go around robbing everybody else
and you'd all wind up equal."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun chuckled in deprecation.
"There would be various
profitable uses, Don. One priceless
one would be scientific observation
of wild life. For that matter there
would be valid usage in everyday
life. There are often personal reasons
for not wishing to be observed.
Celebrities, for instance,
wishing to avoid crowds."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Crowley laughed, "or
a businessman out with his secretary."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun frowned. "Of course,
there are many other aspects. It
would mean the end of such things
as the Iron Curtain. And also the
end of such things as American
immigration control. There are
many, many ramifications, Don,
some of which frighten us. The
world would be never quite the
same."</p>
<p>Crowley leaned forward confidentially.
"Well, I'll tell you. I
was thinking it all out. What we
got to do is turn it over to the
Army and soak them plenty for it."</p>
<p>The others ignored his cutting
himself a piece of the cake.</p>
<p>Ross Wooley merely grunted bitterly.</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently,
"We've thought most of these
things through, Don. However,
Dr. Braun happens to be quite a
follower of Lord Russell."</p>
<p>Crowley looked at her blankly.</p>
<p>"He's a pacifist," she explained.</p>
<p>Braun pushed his glasses back
more firmly on his nose and said,
gently, "The military already have
enough gadgets to destroy quite
literally everything and I trust one
set of them no more than the other.
If <i>both</i> sides had our discovery, then,
very well, each would go about
attempting to find some manner
of penetrating the invisibility, or
taking various measures to protect
their top secrets. But to give it
to just one would be such an
advantage that the other would
have to embark immediately upon
a desperate attack before the advantage
could be fully realized. If we
turn this over to the Pentagon, for
exclusive use, the Soviets would
have to begin a preventative war
as soon as they learned of its
existence."</p>
<p>"You a red?" Crowley said,
scowling.</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged hopelessly.
"No," he said.</p>
<p>Crowley turned to the other two.
"If you think it's the patriotic
thing to do, why don't one of you
sell it to the government?"</p>
<p>Patricia said testily, "You don't
understand, Don. Even if we were
so thoroughly in disagreement that
we would act unilaterally, we
couldn't. You see, this is a three-way
discovery. No one of us knows
the complete process."</p>
<p>His face twisted. "Look, maybe
some of this egghead stuff doesn't
get through to me but I'm not
stupid, see? You got the stuff,
haven't you? You gave me that shot
this morning."</p>
<p>Braun took over, saying reasonably,
"Don, this discovery was hit
upon by accident. The three of us
are employed in the laboratories of
a medical research organization. I
am the department head. Patricia
and Ross were doing some routine
work on a minor problem when
they separately stumbled upon some
rather startling effects, practically
at the same time. Each, separately,
brought their discoveries to me,
and, working you might say intuitively,
I added some conclusions
of my own, and ... well, I repeat,
the discovery was stumbled
upon."</p>
<p>Crowley assimilated that. "None
of you knows how to do it, make
those injections like, by himself?"</p>
<p>"That is correct. Each knows
just one phase of the process. Each
must combine with the other two."</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently, "And
thus far we wish to keep it that
way. Rossie believes the discovery
should be simultaneously revealed
on a world-wide basis, and let man
adapt to it as best he can. I think
it should be suppressed until man
has grown up a little—if he ever
does. The doctor vacillates between
the two positions. What he would
truly like to see, is the method kept
only for the use of qualified scientists,
but even our good doctor
realizes what a dream that is."</p>
<p>Crowley took them all in, one
at a time. "Well, what the devil
are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"That's a good question," Ross
said unhappily.</p>
<p>"This experiment was a farce,"
Patricia said irritably. "After all
our trouble locating Don, our
<i>Common Man</i>, we have found out
nothing that we didn't know before.
His reactions were evidently
largely similar to our own
and...." She broke it off and
frowned thoughtfully. The other
three looked at her questioningly.</p>
<p>Patricia said, "You know, we
simply haven't seen this thing
through as yet."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Pat?"
Ross growled.</p>
<p>She turned to him. "We haven't
given Don the chance to prove
which one of us is right. One day
is insufficient. Half the things he
wished to do, such as sneaking
around picking up stock tips in
Wall Street and inside information
on sporting events...."</p>
<p>"Hey, take it easy," Crowley
protested. "I was just, like,
curious."</p>
<p>Ross said heatedly, "That's not
fair. I'll admit, I, too, thought of
exactly the same possibilities. But
<i>thinking</i> about them and going
through with them are different
things. Haven't you ever thought
about what you'd do if given the
chance to be world-wide supreme
dictator? But, truly, if the job was
offered, would you take it?"</p>
<p>"Good heavens," Patricia said
disgustedly, "remind me to break
off our engagement if I haven't already
done it. I hate overpowering
men. All I'm saying is that we'll
have to give Don at least a week.
One day isn't enough."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun cocked his head to one
side and said uncomfortably, "I'm
not sure but that in a week's time
our friend Don might be able....
See here, Don, do you mind going
on down to the hotel's bar while we
three talk this through?"</p>
<p>Crowley obviously took umbrage
at that, but there was nothing to be
done. Frowning peevishly, he left.</p>
<p>The doctor looked from one to
the other of his associates. "By
Caesar, do you realize the damage
friend Don could accomplish in a
week's time?"</p>
<p>Patricia laughed at him. "That's
what I keep telling the two of you.
Do you realize the damage <i>any</i> person
could do with invisibility? Not
to speak of giving it to every Tom,
Dick and Harry in the world."</p>
<p>Ross said, "We've started this,
lets go through with it. I back Pat's
suggestion, that we give Don sufficient
serum to give him twelve
hours of invisibility a day for a full
week. However, we will ration it
out to him day by day, so that if
things get out of hand we can cut
his supply."</p>
<p>"That's an idea," Patricia said.
"And I suspect that within half the
period we'll all be convinced that
the process will have to be suppressed."</p>
<p>Ross leaned forward. "Good. I
suggest we three keep this suite and
get Don a room elsewhere, so he
won't be inhibited by our continual
presence. Once a day we'll give him
enough serum for one shot and he
can take it any time he wishes to."
He ran his beefy hand back through
his red crew cut in a gesture of satisfaction.
"If he seems to get out of
hand, we'll call it all off."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun cleared his throat unhappily.
"I have premonitions of
disaster, but I suppose if we've
come this far we should see the
experiment through."</p>
<p>Patricia said ungraciously, "At
least the lout will be limited in
his accomplishments by his lack of
imagination. Imagine going into
that French girl's dressing room."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Ross said ludicrously
trying to make his big open face
look dreamy.</p>
<p>"You wretch," Patricia laughed.
"The wedding is off!"</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">But Crowley was no lout. He was
full of the folk wisdom of his
people.</p>
<p><i>God helps those who help themselves.</i></p>
<p><i>It's each man for himself and the
devil take the hindmost.</i></p>
<p>Not to speak of.</p>
<p><i>Never give a sucker an even break.</i></p>
<p><i>If I didn't do it, somebody else
would.</i></p>
<p>Had he been somewhat more of a
student he might also have run into
that nugget of the ancient Greek.
<i>Morals are the invention of the weak
to protect themselves from the strong.</i></p>
<p>Once convinced that the three
eggheads were incapable of realizing
the potentialities of their discovery,
he had little difficulty in
arguing himself into the stand that
he should. It helped considerably to
realize that in all the world only
four persons, including himself,
were aware of the existence of the
invisibility serum.</p>
<p>He spent the first day in what
Marx called in "Das Kapital" the
"original accumulation of capital,"
although it would seem unlikely
that even in the wildest accusations
of the most confirmed Marxist, no
great fortune was ever before begun
in such wise.</p>
<p>It was not necessary, he found, to
walk into a large bank and simply
seemingly levitate the money out
the front door. In fact, that would
have meant disaster. However,
large sums of money are to be found
elsewhere on Manhattan and for
eleven hours Crowley used his native
ingenuity and American know-how,
most of which had been
gleaned from watching TV crime
shows. By the end of the day he
had managed to accumulate in the
neighborhood of a hundred thousand
dollars and was reasonably
sure that the news would not get
back to his sponsors. The fact was,
he had cleaned out the treasuries of
several numbers rackets and those
of two bookies.</p>
<p>It was important, he well realized,
that he be well under way
before the three eggheads decided to
lower the boom.</p>
<p>The second day he spent making
his preliminary contacts, an operation
that was helped by his activities
of the day before. He was beginning
already to get the feel of
the underworld element with which
he had decided he was going to have
to work, at least in the early stages
of his operations.</p>
<p>Any leader, be he military, political
or financial, knows that true
greatness lies in the ability to
choose assistants. Be you a Napoleon
with his marshals, a Roosevelt
with his brain trust, a J. P.
Morgan with his partners, the
truism applies. No great leader has
ever stood alone.</p>
<p>But Crowley also knew instinctively
that he was going to have to
keep the number of his immediate
associates small. They were going
to have to know his secret, and no
man is so naïve as not to realize
that while one person can keep a
secret, it becomes twice as hard for
two and from that point on the
likelihood fades in a geometric
progression.</p>
<p>On the fifth day he knocked on
the door of the suite occupied by
Dr. Braun and his younger associates
and pushed his way in without
waiting for response.</p>
<p>The three were sitting around
awaiting his appearance and to issue
him his usual day's supply of
serum. They greeted him variously,
Patricia with her usual brisk, almost
condescending smile; Dr. Braun
with a gentle nod and a speaking
of his first name; Ross Wooley
sourly. Ross obviously had some
misgivings, the exact nature of
which he couldn't quite put his
finger upon.</p>
<p>Crowley grinned and said, "Hello,
everybody."</p>
<p>"Sit down, Don," Braun said
gently. "We have been discussing
your experiment."</p>
<p>While the newcomer was finding
his seat, Patricia said testily, "Actually,
we are not quite happy
about your reports, Don. We feel
an ... if you'll pardon us ... an
evasive quality about them.
As though you aren't completely
frank."</p>
<p>"In short," Ross snapped, "have
you been pulling things you haven't
told us about?"</p>
<p>Crowley grinned at them. "Now
you folks are downright suspicious."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun indicated some notes
on the coffee table before him. "It
seems hardly possible that your activities
would be confined largely to
going to the cinema, to the swankier
night clubs and eating in the
more famed restaurants."</p>
<p>Crowley's grin turned into a half
embarrassed smirk. Patricia thought
of a small boy who had been caught
in a mischief but was still somewhat
proud of himself. He said, "Well,
I gotta admit that there's been a
few things. Come on over to my
place and I'll show you." He looked
at Braun. "Hey, Doc, about how
much is one of them Rembrandt
paintings worth?"</p>
<p>Braun rolled his eyes toward the
ceiling, "Great Caesar," he murmured.
He came to his feet and
looked around at the rest of them.
"Let us go over there and learn the
worst," he said.</p>
<p>At the curb, before the hotel,
Ross Wooley looked up and down
the street for a cab.</p>
<p>Crowley said, his voice registering
self-deprecation, "Over here."</p>
<p>Over here was a several toned,
fantastically huge hover-limousine,
a nattily dressed, sharp-looking,
expressionless-faced young man behind
the wheel.</p>
<p>The three looked at Crowley.</p>
<p>He opened the door. "Climb in
folks. Nothing too good for you
scientists, eh?"</p>
<p>Inside, sitting next to a window
with Patricia beside him and Dr.
Braun at the far window, and with
Ross in a jump seat, Crowley said
expansively, "This is Larry. Larry,
this is Doc Braun and his friends I
was telling you about, Ross Wooley
and Pat O'Gara. They're like scientists."</p>
<p>Larry said, "Hi," without inflection,
and tooled the heavy car
out into the traffic.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img alt="" height="230" src="images/004.png" title="" width="700"/>
</div>
<p>Ross spun on Crowley. "Don,
where'd you get this car?"</p>
<p>Crowley laughed. "You'll see.
Take it easy. You'll see a lot of
things."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>They were too caught up in their
own thoughts and in the barrage
of demands they were leveling at
Crowley to notice direction. It
wasn't until they were already on
the George Washington Bridge that
Patricia blurted, "Don, this isn't
the way to your hotel!"</p>
<p>Crowley said tolerantly, "Take
it easy, Pat. We're taking a short
detour. Something I have to show
you in Jersey."</p>
<p>"I don't like this," Ross snapped.
The redhead shifted his heavy
shoulders in a reflexive protest
against the confining tweed coat he
wore.</p>
<p>"Relax," Crowley told him reasonably.
"I've been thinking things
out quite a bit and I've got a lot
to discuss with you folks."</p>
<p>They were across the bridge now
and Larry headed into the maze
which finally unraveled itself to the
point that it was obvious they were
heading north. Larry hit the lift
lever and they rose ten feet from the
surface.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun said evenly, "You had
no intention of taking us to your
room. You used that as a ruse to
get us out of our hotel and, further,
across the bridge until we are now
in a position where it's quite impossible
for us to summon police
assistance."</p>
<p>Crowley grinned. "That's right,
Doc. Didn't I tell you these three
were real eggheads, Larry? Look
how quick he figured that out."</p>
<p>Larry grunted in what might
have been amusement.</p>
<p>Ross, growling low in his throat,
turned suddenly in his jump seat
and grabbed Crowley by the coat
front. "What's going on here?"</p>
<p>Crowley snapped, "Larry!"</p>
<p>From seemingly nowhere, the
chauffeur had produced a thin black
automatic and was now lazily
pointing it, not so much at Ross
Wooley as at Dr. Braun and Patricia.
He said evenly, softly, "Easy,
friend."</p>
<p>Ross released his grip, "Put that
thing away," he blurted.</p>
<p>"Sure, sure," Larry said, his
voice all but disinterested. The gun
disappeared.</p>
<p>Crowley, only slightly ruffled,
said now, "Take it easy, Ross.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I'm going to need you folks and I'm
going to treat you right."</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Ross
growled.</p>
<p>"I had the boys rent me a big
estate like up in the Catskills. Big
place, nice and quiet. In fact, the
last tenants used it for one of these
rest sanitariums. You know, rich
people with DTs or trying to get a
monkey off their back."</p>
<p>"The boys?" Patricia said softly.</p>
<p>He looked at her and grinned
again. Crowley was obviously enjoying
himself. "I got a few people
working for me," he explained.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun blurted, "You fool!
You mean you've revealed the existence
of the process Pat, Ross and
I worked out to a group of ignoramuses?"</p>
<p>Crowley said angrily, "Now
look, Doc, let's don't get on that
bit. Maybe I'm just a country boy
but I'm as smart as the next man.
Just because some of you eggheads
spend half your life in college don't
mean you've got any monopoly on
good common sense. I went to the
school of hard knocks, understand,
and I got plenty of diplomas to
prove it. Take it easy on that ignoramus
talk."</p>
<p>Patricia said suddenly, "Don's
right, Dr. Braun. I think you've
badly underestimated him."</p>
<p>Ross snorted sourly at that remark.
"We've all underestimated
him. Well, I think you'll agree that
our friend Don will get no more
injections of the invisibility serum."</p>
<p>Crowley chuckled.</p>
<p>They looked at him. Three sinkings
of stomach taking place simultaneously.</p>
<p>"Now, you know I thought that
might be your altitude...."</p>
<p>"Attitude," Ross muttered.</p>
<p>"... So I went to the trouble
of coming up to your suite last night
and sort of confiscating the supply.
By the looks of it, I'd say there
was enough for another ten shots
or so."</p>
<p>"See," Patricia said to Ross.
"You're not as smart as you thought
you were. Don's one up on you."</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">The estate which the "boys" had
secured for Crowley was two or
three miles out of Tannersville on a
mountainside and quite remote. He
took considerable pride in showing
them about, although it was obvious
that he had been here before
only once himself.</p>
<p>He was obviously enjoying the
situation thoroughly and had
planned it out in some detail. Besides
the empty-faced Larry, who
had driven the car, they were introduced
to two more of Crowley's
confederates, neither of whom gave
any indication that the three were
present under duress. The first was
a heavy-set, moist palmed southerner
with a false air of the jovial. He
shook hands heartily, said nothing
with a good many words for a few
minutes and then excused himself.
The third confidant was an older
man of sad mien who would have
passed easily in the swankest of
Washington, New York or London
private clubs. He was introduced
simply as Mr. Whitely, greeted
them pleasantly as though all were
fellow guests, had a word to say
about the weather then and passed
on.</p>
<p>Patricia was frowning. "Your
southern friend, Paul Teeter, it
seems to me I've heard his name
before."</p>
<p>Crowley grinned. "Oh, Paul's
been in the news from time to
time."</p>
<p>Ross was looking after Mr.
Whitely who had disappeared into
the main building. They were standing
on the lawn, as part of the
guided tour Crowley was giving
them. He growled, "I suppose the
two of them are experienced confidence
men, or something."</p>
<p>"Take it easy with those cracks,
Ross," Crowley said. "Whitely
used to have a seat on the Stock Exchange.
A real big shot. But that
was before they disbarred him, or
whatever they call it."</p>
<p>"See here," Dr. Braun said urgently.
"We've had enough of all
this, Don. I propose we go somewhere
where it will be possible for
us to bring you to your senses, and
save you from disaster."</p>
<p>"Kind of a powwow, eh? O.K.,
Doc, come on in here." He led them
to the entrance, conducted them inside
and into a library that led off
the main <i>entrada</i>. He said, "By the
way, Larry has a few of his boys
up here just kind of like estate
watchmen. Some of them aren't
much used to being out of the city
and they get nervous. So...."</p>
<p>Ross growled, "All right, all
right, don't try to make like a
third-rate villain in a B-Movie.
You have guards about and it would
be dangerous to try to leave without
your permission."</p>
<p>"How about that?" Crowley exclaimed
as though amazed. "Man,
you eggheads catch on quick. Nothing
like a college education." He
waved them to chairs. "I'm going
to have to leave for a while.
Whitely's got some big deal brewing
and we got to work it out."
He grinned suddenly. "And Larry's
got a different kind of deal. One
he's been planning for years but
hasn't been able to swing one or two
details. It's a caution how many details
a little man who wasn't there
can handle in one of these king-size
capers."</p>
<p>He had used the pseudo-criminal
term, caper, with considerable satisfaction.
Crowley was obviously
having the time of his life.</p>
<p>"Very well," Braun said, "we'll
wait." When the other had left the
room, leaving the door open behind
him, the doctor turned to his
two younger associates. "What
children we've been."</p>
<p>Ross Wooley growled unhappily,
"Brother, we couldn't have picked
a worse so-called Common Man, if
we'd tried. That character is as
nutty as a stuffed date. Do you realize
what he's in a position to do?"</p>
<p>Patricia twisted her mouth
thoughtfully. "I wonder if any of
us really realize. I am afraid even
with all our speculation, we never
truly thought this out."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun pushed his glasses back
on his nose with a forefinger. He
shook his head. "You make a mistake,
Ross. We didn't make a bad
choice in our selection of Don
Crowley for our typical Common
Man."</p>
<p>Ross looked at him and snorted.</p>
<p>Braun said doggedly, "Remember,
we attempted to find the average
man, the common man, the little
man, the man in the street.
Well, it becomes obvious to me that
we did just that."</p>
<p>Patricia said thoughtfully, "I
don't know. I'm inclined to think
that from the beginning you two
have underestimated Don. He has
certainly shown considerable ingenuity.
Do you realize that he's
done all this in a matter of less than
a week?"</p>
<p>"Done all <i>what</i>?" Ross said sarcastically.</p>
<p>She gestured. "Look at this establishment.
He's obviously acquired
considerable money, and he
already has an organization, or at
least the beginnings of one."</p>
<p>"That is beside the point," Braun
said ruefully. "I say that he is reacting
as would be expected. As the
average man in the street would
react given the opportunity to seize
almost unlimited power, and with
small chance of reprisal."</p>
<p>Patricia shrugged as though in
disagreement.</p>
<p>Braun looked at Ross Wooley.
"Close the door, Ross. Lord knows
when we'll have another chance to
confer. Obviously, something must
be done."</p>
<p>Ross came quickly to his feet,
crossed to the door, looked up and
down the hallway which was
empty and then closed the door behind
him. He came back to the
others and drew his chair in closer
so that they could communicate
in low voices.</p>
<p>Braun said, "One thing is definite.
We must not allow him to
secure further serum. For all we
know, he might be planning to inject
some of those gangsters he's
affiliated himself with."</p>
<p>Patricia shook her head thoughtfully.
"I still think you underestimate
Don. He must realize he
can't trust them. At this stage, he
has had to confide in at least two
or three, fully to utilize his invisibility.
But in the long run it isn't
to his advantage to have <i>anybody</i>
know about it. If the authorities,
such as the F.B.I., began looking
for an invisible man, sooner or
later they would penetrate the field
of invisibility."</p>
<p>"You mean you think Crowley
will use these men for a time and
then ... destroy them?"</p>
<p>"He'll have to, or sooner or later
the secret will be out."</p>
<p>Braun said in soft logic, "If he
can't allow anyone to know about
it, then we, too, must be destroyed."</p>
<p>Ross growled, "Then we've got
to finish him first."</p>
<p>Patricia said, "Now, I don't
know. Don is showing considerably
more sense than you two evidently
give him credit for. I think
in many ways what he's done is
quite admirable. He's seen his chance—and
has grasped it. Why, I wouldn't
be surprised that Don will be the
most powerful man in the country
within months."</p>
<p>The two men were staring at her.
Ross sputtered, "Have you gone
completely around the bend? Are
you defending this ... this...."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>A voice chuckled, "Mind your
language, Buster. Just take it easy
or you'll wind up with some missing
teeth."</p>
<p>Ross jumped to his feet as though
couched with an electric prod. Dr.
Braun stiffened in his chair and his
eyes darted about the room.</p>
<p>Patricia alone seemed collected.
"Don Crowley!" she exclaimed.
"You should be ashamed of yourself,
listening in on private conversations."</p>
<p>"Yeah," the voice said. "However,
it's handy to know what the
other side is dreaming up in the
way of a bad time for you. Sit down,
Buster. I've got a few things to
say."</p>
<p>Muttering, Ross resumed his
place. The doctor sighed deeply and
sank back onto the sofa he had
been occupying. The three could see
an indentation magically appear in
the upholstery of an easy-chair
across from them.</p>
<p>Crowley's voice said confidently,
"You know, from the first, I've
kept telling you eggheads that I'm
not stupid, but none of you've
bothered to listen. You think just
because you spent six or eight years
of your life in some college that
you're automatically smarter than
other people. But I got a theory,
like, that it doesn't make any difference
if you spent your whole life
going to college, you still wouldn't
wind up smart if you didn't start
that way."</p>
<p>Ross began to mutter something,
but Crowley snapped, "Shut up
for a minute, I'm talking." He resumed
his condescending tone. "Just
for example, take a couple of guys
who got to the top. Edison in
science and Khrushchev in politics.
For all practical purposes, neither
of them went to school at all.
Khrushchev didn't even learn to
read until he was twenty-eight
years old.</p>
<p>"Then take Dr. Braun here. He's
spent half his life in school, and
where's it got him? He'd make
more dough if he owned the local
garage and dealer franchise for one
of the automobile companies in
some jerkwater town. And look at
Ross. He'd probably make more
money playing pro football than
he does messing around with all
those test tubes and Bunsen burners
and everything. What good has all
the school done either?"</p>
<p>Dr. Braun said gently, "Could we
get to the point?"</p>
<p>"Take it easy, Doc. I'm in charge
here. You just sit and listen. The
point is, you three with your smart-Aleck
egghead education started off
thinking Mr. Common Man, like
you call me, is stupid. Well, it just
so happens I'm not. Take Pat there.
She's smarter than you two, but
she had the same idea. That this
here country boy isn't as smart as
she is. She's going to fox him, see?
As soon as she saw the way the
cards were falling, she started
buttering up to me. She even figured
out that I was probably right in
this room listening to you planning
how to trip me up. So she pretended
to take sides against you."</p>
<p>"Why, Don!" Patricia protested.</p>
<p>"Come off it, kid. You probably
hate my guts worse than the others.
You were the one who thought this
<i>particular</i> average man was a slob.
That all common people were
slobs."</p>
<p>Patricia's face went expressionless,
but Ross, knowing her well,
could sense her dismay. Crowley
was right. She had been trying to
play a careful game but their supposedly
average man had seen
through her.</p>
<p>Crowley's voice went thoughtful.
"I been doing a lot of thinking
this week. A lot of it. And you
want to know something? You
know what I decided? I decided
that everybody talks a lot about
the Common Man but actually he's
never had a chance to, like, express
himself. He's never been able to
put over the things he's always
wanted."</p>
<p>"Haven't you ever heard of democracy?"
Ross said sourly. "Who
do you think elects our officials?"</p>
<p>"Shut up, I told you. I'm talking
now. Sure, every four years the
lousy politicians come around and
they stick coonskin caps on their
heads or Indian bonnets and start
saying ain't when they make their
speeches. Showing they're just
folks, see? They go out into the
country, and stick a straw in their
mouth and talk about crops to the
farmers, all that sort of thing. But
they aren't <i>really</i> common folks.
Most of them are lawyers or bankers
or something. They run those
political parties and make all the
decisions themselves. The Common
Man never really has anything to
say about it."</p>
<p>Braun said reasonably, "You
have your choice. If you think one
candidate is opposed to your interests
you can elect the other."</p>
<p>Crowley grunted his contempt.
"But they're both the same. No,
there hasn't been no common man
in Washington since Lincoln, and
maybe he wasn't. Well, I'll tell you
something. The kind of talk I hear
down in the corner saloon from just
plain people makes a lot more sense
to me than all this stuff the politicians
pull."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun cleared his throat and
stared at the seemingly empty chair
from whence came the other's belligerent
voice. "Are you thinking
of entering politics, Don?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I am."</p>
<p>"Good heavens," Patricia ejaculated.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not smart enough, eh?
Well, listen baby, the eggheads
don't seem to be so great in there.
Maybe it's time the Common Man
took over."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun said reasonably, "But
see here, Crowley, the ability to
achieve invisibility doesn't give
you any advantages in swinging
elections or...." He broke off in
mid-sentence and did a mental
double take.</p>
<p>Crowley laughed in contempt.
"The biggest thing you need to win
elections, Doc, is plenty of dough.
And I'll have that. But I'll also
have the way to do more muck-raking
than anybody in history.
<i>I'll</i> sit in on every important private
get-together those crook politicians
have. I'll get the details of
every scheme they cook up. I'll get
into any safe or safe deposit box.
I'll have the common people, you
sneer so much about, screaming for
their blood."</p>
<p>Ross rumbled, "What do you expect
to accomplish in office, Crowley?"</p>
<p>The voice became expansive.
"Lots of things. Take this Cold
War. If you drop into any neighborhood
bar, you'll hear what the
common man thinks about it."</p>
<p>The three of them stared at the
seemingly empty chair.</p>
<p>"Drop the bomb first!" Crowley
snapped. "Finish those reds off before
they start it. In fact, I'm not
even sure they've got the bomb.
They're not smart enough to...."</p>
<p>"There was sputnik, you know,"
Ross interrupted sourly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but built by those captured
German scientists. We're way
ahead of those Russkies in everything.
Hit 'em now. Finish 'em off.
The eggheads in Washington are
scared of their own shadows. Another
thing I'd end is getting suckered
in by those French and English
politicians. What does America
need with those countries? They always
start up these wars and get us
to bail them out. And I say stop
all this foreign aid and keep the
money in our own country.</p>
<p>"And we can do a lot of cleaning
up right here, too. We got to kick
all the commies out of the government.
Make all the commies and
socialists and these egghead liberals,
illegal. In fact, I'm in favor of
shooting them. When you got an
enemy, finish him off. And take the
Jews. I'm not anti-Semitic, like,
understand. Some of my best friends
are Jews. But you got to realize
that wherever they go they cause
trouble. They stick together and
take over the best businesses and all.
O.K., you know what I say? I say
kick them out of the country. And
they all came over here poor and
made their money here. So let them
leave the way they came. We'll,
like, confiscate all their property
except like personal things."</p>
<p>Patricia had closed her eyes in
pain long before this. She said,
softly, "I imagine somewhere along
in here we'll get to the Negroes."</p>
<p>"I'm not against them. Just so
they stay in their place. But this
integration stuff is bunk. You got
to face facts. Negroes aren't as
smart as white people, neither are
Chinks or Mexicans or Puerto
Ricans. So, O.K., give them their
own schools, up to high school is
all they need, and let them have
jobs like waiters and janitors and
like that. They shouldn't take a
white man's job and they shouldn't
be allowed to marry white people.
It deteriorates the race, like."</p>
<p>Crowley was really becoming
wound up now. Wound up and expansive.
"There's a lot of things
I'd change, see. Take freedom of
speech and press and like that.
Sure I believe in that, I'm one hundred
per cent American. But you
can't allow people to talk against
the government. Freedom of speech
is O.K., but you can't let a guy
jump up in the middle of a theater
and yell fire."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Ross growled. "Freedom
of speech is more important
than a few movie houses full of people.
Besides, if one man is allowed
to jump up and yell fire, then somebody
else can yell out 'You're a
liar, there is no fire.'"</p>
<p>"You're not funny," Crowley
said ominously.</p>
<p>"I wasn't trying to be," Ross
muttered, and then blurred into
sudden action. He shot to his feet,
and then, arms extended, dashed
toward the source of the voice. He
hit the chair without slowing,
grappled crazily.</p>
<p>"I've got him!" He wrestled
awkwardly, fantastically, seemingly
in an insane tumbling without
opponent.</p>
<p>Patricia was on her feet. She
grasped an antique bronze candle-holder
and darted toward the now
fallen chair and to where Ross was
wrestling desperately on the floor.
Crowley was attempting to shout,
but was largely smothered.</p>
<p>Patricia held the candlestick at
the ready, trying to find an opening,
trying to locate the invisible Crowley's
head.</p>
<p>Frederick Braun staggered to his
own feet, bewildered, shaking.</p>
<p>A voice from the door said flatly,
"O.K., that's it." Then, sharper,
"I said cut it out. You all right,
Mr. Crowley?"</p>
<p>It was Larry. His thin black
automatic was held almost negligently
in his right hand. He ran his
eyes up and down Patricia, taking
in the candlestick weapon. His
ordinarily empty face registered a
flicker of amused approval.</p>
<p>Patricia gasped, "Oh, no,"
dropped her bludgeon and sank into
a chair, her head in her hands.</p>
<p>Ross, his face in dismay, came
slowly to his feet. The redhead
stared at the gunman, momentarily
considering further attack. Larry,
ignoring both
Braun and
Patricia, swung the gun to cover
him exclusively. "I wouldn't," he
said emptily.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, Ross' head jerked
backward. His nose flattened, crushingly,
and then spurted blood. He
reeled back, his head flinging this
way and that, bruises and cuts appeared
magically.</p>
<p>Crowley's voice raged, "You
asked for it, wise guy. How do you
like these apples?"</p>
<p>The saturnine Larry chuckled
sourly. "Hey, take it easy, chief.
You'll kill the guy."</p>
<p>Ross had crumpled to the floor.
There were still sounds of blows.
Crowley raged, "You're lucky I'm
not wearing shoes, I'd break every
rib in your body!"</p>
<p>Patricia was staring in hopeless
horror. She said sharply, "Don, remember
you need Ross! You need
all of us! Without all of us there
can be no more serum."</p>
<p>The blows stopped.</p>
<p>"There will be no more serum
anyway," Braun said shakily. The
thin little man still stood before
his chair having moved not at all
since the action began.</p>
<p>Crowley's heavy breathing could
be heard but he managed a snarl.
"That's what you think, Doc."</p>
<p>Braun said, "By Caesar, I absolutely
refuse to...."</p>
<p>Crowley interrupted ominously.
"You know, Doc, that's where this
particular common man has it all
over you eggheads. You spend so
much time reading, you don't take
in the action shows on TV. Now
what you're thinking is that even
if we were going to twist your arm
a little, you'd stick to your guns.
But suppose, like, it was Pat we
was working on, while you had to
sit and watch."</p>
<p>The elderly man's brave front
collapsed and his thin shoulders
slumped.</p>
<p>Crowley barked a laugh.</p>
<p>Patricia by now, was bent over
the unconscious Ross crying even as
she tried to help him.</p>
<p>Crowley said to the silent, all
but disinterested Larry, "Have
these three put in separate rooms
in that section they used for the
violent wing when the place was a
nuthouse. Have a good guard and
see they don't talk back and
forth."</p>
<p>"You're the boss," Larry said
languidly.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">Crowley was thorough. For that
they had to give him credit. They
were kept divided, each in a different
room-cell and with at least
two burly, efficient guards on constant
watch. They were fed on army-type
trays and their utensils checked
carefully. There was no communication
allowed—even with the
guard.</p>
<p>The second day, Crowley took
measures to see their disappearance
raised no alarm at either their place
of employment or at their residences.
This raised few problems
since all were single and all had
already taken off both from the
job and from their homes in order
to carry out their experiment.
Crowley forced them to write further
notes and letters finding excuses
for extending their supposed
vacations. He also had Larry return
to the hotel suite, pay their bill,
pack their things and bring them
to the Catskill estate which had
become their prison.</p>
<p>He had them make up lists of
materials and equipment they would
need for further manufacture of the
serum upon which they had stumbled,
and sent off men to acquire
the things.</p>
<p>And on three occasions during the
following weeks he had them
brought from their cells and spent
an hour or so with them at lunch
or dinner. Crowley evidently needed
an audience beyond that of his
henchmen. The release of his basic
character, formerly repressed, was
progressing geometrically and there
seemed to be an urgency to crow,
to brag, to boast.</p>
<div class="figrightb" style="width: 192px;">

<div class="figrightb" style="width: 399px;">
<img alt="" height="173" src="images/005-2.png" title="" width="399"/>
</div>
<p>On the third of these
occasions he was
already seated at the table when
they were ushered into the dining
room. Crowley dismissed the guards
with a wave of his hand as though
they were liveried servants.</p>
<p>All had eaten but there were
liqueurs and coffee, cigars and cigarettes
on the broad table.</p>
<p>Ross sank into a chair and
growled, "Well, what hath the
great man wrought by now?"</p>
<p>Crowley grinned at him, poured
coffee and then a dollop of Napoleon
brandy into it. He gestured with a
hand. "Help yourselves, folks. How
you feeling? You been getting all
the books you wanted? You look
kind of peaked, Pat."</p>
<p>"Miss O'Gara to you, you ape
with delusions of grandeur," she
snapped. "When are you going to
let us out of those prison cells?"</p>
<p>Crowley wasn't provoked. The
strong can afford to laugh at the
malcontented weak. "That's one of
the things you never know," he
said easily. "You sure you want
out? Something the Doc said the
other day had a lotta fact in it.
The fewer people know about this
secret of mine, the better off I'll be
and the better off I am, the better
off the whole country is going to
be and I gotta think about that. I
got responsibilities."</p>
<p>"A combination of Engine Charley
and Louis XIV, eh?" Ross
muttered, running his beefy hand
back over his crew cut. It was a
relief to get out of his room and
talk with the others, but he didn't
want Crowley to see that.</p>
<p>"What's that?" the other was
impatient of conversation that went
above his head.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun explained gently. "One
said, <i>I am the State</i>, and the other,
<i>anything that's good for my corporation
is good for the United States</i>—or something
quite similar."</p>
<p>Crowley sipped at his coffee royal.
"Well, anyway, Pat, the day
you're ready to leave that cell,
you'd better start worrying cause
that'll mean I don't need you any
more."</p>
<p>Ross growled, "You didn't answer
my question. Robbed any
banks lately, great man?"</p>
<p>The other eyed him coldly. "Take
it easy, Buster. Maybe in the early
stages of the Common Man Movement
we hafta take some strong-arm
measures, but that stage's
about finished."</p>
<p>Patricia O'Gara was interested
in spite of herself. She said. "You
mean you already have all the
money you need?"</p>
<p>He was expansive. Obviously
there was nothing to lose with these
three and he liked a sounding board.
In spite of his alleged contempt for
eggheads there was an element in
Crowley which wished to impress
them, to grant him equal status in
their own estimations.</p>
<p>"There's a devil of a lot to know
about big finance. You need a starter,
but once you get it, the stuff
just rolls in automatic." He grinned
suddenly, almost boyishly. "Especially
when you got a certain
little advantage, like me."</p>
<p>Braun said, interestedly, "How
do you put your advantage to
work?"</p>
<p>"Well, now, I gotta admit we
aren't quite out of the woods. We
need more capital to work with,
but after tonight we'll have it. Remember
that Brinks job up in New
England a long time ago? Well, we
got something lined up even bigger.
I work with Larry and his boys to
pull it. Then there's another thing
cooking that Whitely's been keeping
tabs on. It looks like IBM is
going to split its stock, three for
one. I gotta attend their next secret
executive meeting and find out. If
they do, we buy in just before, see?
We buy on margin, buy options, all
that sort of jazz. Whitely knows all
about it. Then we got another big
deal in Washington. Looks like the
government might devaluate the
dollar. Whitely explained it to me,
kind of. Anyway, I got to sit in on
a conference the President's gonna
have. If they really decide to devalue,
then Whitely and me, we
go ahead and put every cent we got
into Swiss gold. Then the day after
devaluation, we switch it all back
into dollars again. Double our
money. Oh, we got all sorts of
angles, Doc."</p>
<p>"By Caesar," Braun ejaculated.
"You seem to have."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>Patricia had poured herself some
coffee and was sipping it, black,
even as she stared at him. "But,
Don, what do you need all this
money for? You already have more
than plenty. Why not call it all off.
Get out from under."</p>
<p>Ross grunted, "Too late, Pat.
Can't you see? He's got the power
urge already."</p>
<p>Crowley ignored him and turned
to her, pouring more coffee and
cognac for himself. "I'm not running
up all this dough just for me.
You think you're the only one's
got ideals, like? Let me tell you, I
might just be a country boy but I
got ambitions to put some things
right in this world."</p>
<p>"Such as...." Patricia prodded,
bitterness in her voice.</p>
<p>"Aw, we went through all that
the other day. The thing is, now
it's really under way. If you was
seeing the newspapers these days,
you'd know about the Common
Man Party."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh," Ross muttered unhappily.</p>
<p>"It's just getting under way,"
Crowley said modestly, "but we're
hiring two of the top Madison
Avenue outfits to handle publicity
and we're recruiting some of the
best practical politicians in the
field."</p>
<p>"Practical politicians!" Ross
snorted. "Types like Huey Long,
McCarthy, Pendergast, I suppose."</p>
<p>The other misunderstood him.
"Yeah, and even better. We're going
in big for TV time, full-page ads
in the newspapers and magazines.
That sort of thing. The average
man's getting tired of the same old
talk from the Republicans and Democrats.
Paul Teeter thinks we might
have a chance in the next election,
given enough dough to plow into
it."</p>
<p>Ross leaned back disdainfully.
"What a combination. Whitely,
the broker who has been barred
from activity on Wall Street; Teeter,
the crooked politician, but with
connections from top to bottom;
and Larry, whatever his name
is...."</p>
<p>"Morazzoni," Crowley supplied.
"You know where I first ran into
his name? In one of them true crime
magazines. He's a big operator."</p>
<p>"I'll bet he is," the redhead
growled. "Probably with good
Mafia connections. I'm surprised
you haven't attempted to take over
that outfit."</p>
<p>Crowley laughed abruptly.
"We're working on that, pal. Just
take it easy and all these things
will work their way out. But meanwhile
I didn't bring you jokers here
to make snide remarks. I got work
for you. I'm fresh out of that serum
and you three are going to brew me
up another batch."</p>
<p>They looked at him, Dr. Braun,
Ross Wooley, Patricia O'Gara,
their faces registering stubbornness,
revolt and dismay.</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Larry and
some of his boys have experience. I
gotta admit, I wouldn't even want
to watch."</p>
<p>"I'm for standing firm," Braun
said stiffly. "There are but three of
us. The most they can do is kill us.
But if this man's insanity is released
on the world...."</p>
<p>Crowley was shaking his head in
deprecation. "Like when you say
the worst we can do is kill you.
Man, haven't you heard about the
Nazis and commies and all? You
oughta read some of the men's adventure
magazines. How do you
think Joe Stalin got all them early
Bolsheviks to confess? You think
they weren't tough buzzards? Why
make us go to all the trouble, when
you'd just cave in eventually anyway?
Save yourself the grief."</p>
<p>Patricia said impatiently, "He's
right, I'm afraid. I would collapse
rather quickly under physical coercion.
You might last a bit longer,
Ross possibly longer still. But in the
end we would concede."</p>
<p>Crowley said, as though in amazement,
"You know, eggheads aren't
as stupid as some would reckon.
O.K., folks, I got a laboratory all
fixed up with your things. Let's
go. Ah, Ross, old pal, I'm carrying
heat, as Larry would say, so let's
don't have any trouble, eh?"</p>
<p>He had been as good as his word
in regards to the laboratory. It was
obviously one of the rooms used by
the staff when the place had been
a sanitarium. Now, each of the
three had all the equipment and
supplies they required.</p>
<p>Crowley took a seat at the far
end of the room, facing them. There
had been a guard outside the door
when they entered and a call would
bring him in seconds. Even so,
Crowley sat in such wise that his
right hand was ready to plunge inside
his coat to the gun that evidently
was holstered there. He said,
"O.K., folks, let's get about it."</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>It took them half an hour or so
to sort out those materials each
needed in his own contribution to
the end product.</p>
<p>Their captor looked at his watch
impatiently. "Let's get a move on,
here. I thought this was going to
take a few minutes."</p>
<p>Patricia said testily, "What's the
hurry, Don?"</p>
<p>He grinned at her. "Tonight's
the big night. This evening, just
before closing, I walk into.... Well,
you don't have to know the
name. Like I said, it'll make the
Brinks job look like peanuts. They
lock up the place and leave, see?
O.K., about two o'clock in the
morning, when the city's dead,
Larry and the boys drive up into an
alley, behind. I go around, one by
one, and sock the four guards on
the back of the head. Then I open
up for Larry and they take their
time and clear the place out. From
then on, we got all the dough we
need to start pyramiding it up on
the Stock Exchange and like that."</p>
<p>Patricia had drawn on rubber
gloves, pulled a lab apron around
her. She began reaching for test
tubes, measuring devices. She murmured
softly, "What keeps you
from telling yourself you're nothing
but a crook, Don? When we
first met you—it seems a terribly
long time ago, back there in Far
Cry—you didn't seem to be such a
bad egg."</p>
<p>"We didn't know, then, he was a
cracked egg," Ross muttered. He
looked to where Crowley slouched,
his eyes narrow as though considering
his chances of rushing the
other. Crowley grinned and shook
his head. "Don't try it, Buster."</p>
<p>Crowley looked at Patricia. "You
don't get it, sister. It's like somebody
or other said. The ends, uh,
justify the means. That means...."</p>
<p>"I know what it means," Patricia
said impatiently.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun, who rather hopelessly
was also beginning to work at the
equipment their captor had provided,
said reasonably, "Don, the
greater number of the thinkers of
the world have rejected that maxim.
If you will, umah, analyze it, you
will find that the end and the
means are one."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, a lot of complicated
egghead gas. What I'm saying,
Pat, is that what I'm eventually
heading for is good for
everybody. At least it's good for
all real hundred per cent Americans.
Everybody's going to go to
college and guaranteed to come out
with what you three got, a doctor's
degree. Everybody's going to get a
guaranteed annual wage, like,
whether or not they can do any
work. It's not a guy's fault if he
gets sick or unemployed or something.
Everybody...."</p>
<p>"Shades of all the social-reformers
who ever lived," Ross muttered.</p>
<p>"By Caesar," Braun said in despair,
"I have an idea you'll get
the vote of every halfwit in the
country."</p>
<p>Crowley came to his feet. "I
don't like that kind of talk, Doc.
Maybe I'm just a country boy, but
I know what the common man
wants and what I'm going to do is
give it to him."</p>
<p>Patricia looked up from her work
long enough to frown at him.
"What special are you going to get
out of this, Don?"</p>
<p>That took him back for a moment
and he scowled at her.</p>
<p>"Come, come," she said.
"You've already admitted to we
three just what you think and are
going to do. Now, how do you
picture yourself, after all this has
been accomplished?"</p>
<p>His face suddenly broke into its
grin, a somewhat sly element in it
now. "You know, when I get this
all worked out, the folks are going
to be pretty thankful."</p>
<p>"I'll bet," Ross muttered. He,
too, was working at his element of
compounding the serum.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they will, Buster,"
Crowley said truculently. "And
they're going to want to show it.
You ever seen one of those movies
like 'Ben Hur' back in Roman days?
Can you imagine everybody in the
whole country thinking you were
the best guy ever lived? You know,
like an Emperor."</p>
<p>"Like Caligula," Dr. Braun said
softly.</p>
<p>"I don't know any of their
names, but they really had it made.
Snap your fingers and there's a big
banquet with the best floor show in
the world. Snap your fingers and
here comes the sexiest dames in
Hollywood. Snap your fingers and
some big entertainment like a
chariot race, or something. Once I
put this over, the Common Man
Party, that's the way people are
going to feel about me and want to
treat me."</p>
<p>"And if they don't, you'll make
them?" Ross said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"You're too smart for your
own britches, egghead," Crowley
snarled. He looked at his watch.
"Let's get this rolling. I got to get
on down to the city and start this
caper going."</p>
<p>Ross handed a test tube to Dr.
Braun and began stripping the
gloves from his hands. "That's my
contribution," he said.</p>
<p>Patricia had already delivered
hers. Dr. Braun combined them,
then heated the compound, adding
a distillate of his own. He said,
"When this cools...."</p>
<p>Crowley crossed the room to the
door and said something to the
guard there. He returned in a
moment with an anthropoid ape in
a cage. He sat it on the table and
looked at them.</p>
<p>"O.K.," he said to Braun, his
voice dangerous. "Let's see you
inject the monk with this new
batch of serum."</p>
<p>Braun raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>The other watched him narrowly,
saying nothing further.</p>
<p>Dr. Braun shrugged, located a
hypodermic needle and prepared it.
In a matter of moments, the animal
was injected.</p>
<p>Ross Wooley said sourly, "Don't
you trust your fellow man, Don?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't, and stop calling
me Don. It's Dan. Daniel
Crowley."</p>
<p>The three of them looked at him
in bewilderment.</p>
<p>The ape was beginning to shimmer
as though he was being seen
through a window wet with driving
rain.</p>
<p>"Don's my goody-goody brother.
Used to live in the same house with
me, but ever since we were kids
and I got picked up on a juvenile
delinquent rap for swiping a car,
he's been snotty. Anyway, now
he's moved out to Frisco."</p>
<p>Patricia blurted, "But ... but
you let us believe you were
Donald...."</p>
<p>He brushed it off with a flick of
his hand. "You said you had some
deal where I could make me some
money. O.K., I was between jobs."</p>
<p>The ape was invisible now.
Crowley peered in at him. "Seems
to work, all right."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun sighed. "I am not a
Borgia, Daniel Crowley."</p>
<p>"You're not a what?"</p>
<p>"Never mind. I wouldn't poison
even you, if that is what you
feared."</p>
<p>Daniel Crowley took up the new
container of serum and put a lid on
it. He said, "I got to get going.
The guy out in front will get you
back to your rooms. No tricks with
him, Buster"—he was talking
directly to Ross—"he's already
beat a couple of homicide raps."</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;"/>
<p class="cap">Back in their cell-rooms, they
found that there was but one guard.
Evidently, the all-out robbery attempt
to be held this night involved
practically all of Larry
Morazzoni's forces. Beyond that,
this guard did not seem particularly
interested in keeping them from
talking back and forth to each
other through the peepholes that
centered their doors.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours during
which time they largely held
silence, immersed in their own
thoughts, Dr. Braun called out,
"Patricia, Ross, I should tender my
apologies. It was my less than
brilliant idea to find the average
man and use him as a guinea pig."</p>
<p>"No apology necessary," Patricia
said impatiently. "We all
went into it with open eyes."</p>
<p>"But you were correct, Pat," the
doctor said unhappily. "Our common
man turned out to be a Frankenstein
monster."</p>
<p>Ross growled, "That's the trouble.
It turned out he wasn't our
common man but his brother,
whose petty criminal record evidently
goes back to juvenile days."</p>
<p>"Even that doesn't matter,"
Patricia said testily. "I've about
come to the conclusion that it
wouldn't have made any difference
<i>who</i> we'd put in Don's ... I mean
Daniel Crowley's position. Man is
too near the animal, as yet at least,
to be trusted with such power.
Any man."</p>
<p>"Why, Pat," Dr. Braun said
doggedly, "I don't quite believe
you correct. For instance, do you
feel the same about me? Would
I have reacted like our friend
Dan?" He chuckled in deprecation.</p>
<p>"That's my point," she said. "I
think you would ... ultimately.
Once again look at the Caesars,
they held godlike power."</p>
<p>"You're thinking of such as
Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Commodus...."</p>
<p>"I'm also thinking of such as
Claudius, the scholar who was
practically forced to take the Imperial
mantle. And Marcus Aurelius,
the philosopher who although
bound up in learning himself allowed
his family free rein in their
vices and finally turned the Empire
over to his son Commodus, one of
the most vicious men of all time.
But take Caligula and Nero if you
will. Both of them stepped into
power comparatively clean and
with the best of prospects. Well
approved, well loved. What happened
to them when given power
without restraint?"</p>
<p>Ross grumbled, "I admit I missed
the boat, but not for the reasons
Pat presents. In a sane society,
our serum would be a valuable
contribution. But in a dog eat dog
world, where it's each man for
himself, then it becomes a criminal
tool."</p>
<p>Patricia said sarcastically, "And
can you point out a sane society?"</p>
<p>Ross grunted. "No," he said.
After a moment he added, "You
know, in a way Crowley was right.
We three eggheads didn't do so
well up against what he called his
common sense. I tried to slug him,
with negative results. Dr. Braun,
you tried sweet reason on him.
Forgive me if I laugh. Pat, you
tried your womanly wiles, but he
saw through that, too."</p>
<p>"The chickens have not all come
home to roost," Patricia said
mysteriously. "What time is it?"</p>
<p>Ross told her.</p>
<p>She called to the guard, "See
here, you."</p>
<p>"Shut up. You ain't supposed
to be talking at all. Go to sleep."</p>
<p>"I want to speak to Mr. Morazzoni.
It's very important and you
are going to be dreadfully sorry if
you don't bring him."</p>
<p>"Larry can't be bothered. He's
getting ready to go on down to the
city."</p>
<p>"I know what he's doing, but
if he doesn't listen to me, he's
going to be very unhappy and
probably full of bullet holes."</p>
<p>The guard came over to her door
and stared at her for a long moment.
He checked the lock on her door
and then those of Dr. Braun and
Ross Wooley. "We'll see who's
going to be sorry," he grunted. He
turned and left.</p>
<hr style="width: 20%;"/>
<p>When he returned it was with
both Larry Morazzoni and Paul
Teeter, Dan Crowley's political adviser.
Morazzoni growled, "What
goes on? You squares looking for
trouble?"</p>
<p>Patricia said testily, "I suggest
you let us out of here, Mr. Morazzoni.
If you do, we pledge not to
press kidnaping charges against
you. I believe you are aware of the
penalty in this State."</p>
<p>"You trying to be funny?"</p>
<p>"Definitely not, Mr. Morazzoni,"
Patricia said icily. "Daniel
Crowley bragged to us of your plans
for tonight."</p>
<p>The hoodlum muttered a contemptuous
obscenity under his
breath.</p>
<p>Paul Teeter, the heavy-set southerner
said jovially, "But what has
this to do with releasing you,
Miss O'Gara? Admittedly Dan is
a bit indiscreet but...." He
let the sentence fade away.</p>
<p>"Yes," Patricia said. "I realize
that he is a nonprofessional in your
ranks, and have little doubt that
eventually you would have surmounted
whatever precautions he
has taken to keep you in underling
positions. That's beside the point.
The point is that by this time
Daniel Crowley has, ah, infiltrated
the institution you expected to
burglarize tonight. He is inside,
and you are still outside. There
are four guards also inside, whom
he is expected to eliminate before
you can join him."</p>
<p>"He told you everything all
right, the jerk," Larry said coldly.
"But so what?"</p>
<p>"So Dan Crowley had us make
up a new amount of serum tonight
and tested it on a chimpanzee in
the lab. If you'll go and check,
you'll undoubtedly find the chimp
is again visible."</p>
<p>The gunman looked at Paul
Teeter blankly.</p>
<p>The other's reactions were
quicker. "The serum lasts for
twelve hours," Teeter barked.</p>
<p>"This batch lasts for three
hours," Patricia said definitely.
"Your friend Crowley is suddenly
going to become visible right before
the eyes of those four guards—and
long before he had expected
to eliminate them."</p>
<p>Teeter barked, "Larry, check
that monkey."</p>
<p>Doc Braun spoke up for the
first time since the appearance of
the two. He said dryly, "You'll
also notice that the animal is sound
asleep. It seems that I added a slow-acting
but rather potent sleeping
compound to the serum."</p>
<p>The gunman started from the
room in a rush.</p>
<p>Ross called after him, "If you'll
look closely, you'll also note the
chimp's skin has turned a brilliant
red. There have been some basic
changes in the pigment."</p>
<p>"Holy smokes," Paul Teeter
protested, moping his face with a
handkerchief. "Didn't he take any
precautions against you people at
all?"</p>
<p>Ross said, "He was too busy
telling us how smart a country boy
he happened to be."</p>
<p>Larry returned in moments, biting
his lip in the first nervous
manifestation any of them had
ever seen in him. He took Teeter
to one side.</p>
<p>Patricia called to them impatiently.
"You have no time and no
one to contact Crowley now. Don't
be fools. Mend your bridges while
you can. Let us out of here, and
we'll prefer no charges."</p>
<p>Larry was a man of quick decisions.
He snapped to the blank-faced
guard who had assimilated
only a fraction of all this, "Go on
back to the boys and tell them to
start packing to get out of here.
Tell them the fix has chilled. It's
all off. I'll be there in a few minutes."</p>
<p>"O.K., chief." The other had
the philosophical outlook of those
who were meant to take orders
and knew it. He left.</p>
<p>Larry and Teeter opened the cell
doors.</p>
<p>Teeter said, "How do we know
we can trust you?"</p>
<p>Ross looked at him.</p>
<p>Larry said, "It's a deal. Give us
an hour to get out of here. Then
use the phone if you want to call a
taxi, or whatever. I ain't stupid,
this thing was too complicated to
begin with."</p>
<p>When Teeter and Morazzoni were
gone, the three stood alone in the
corridor, looking at each other.</p>
<p>The doctor pushed his glasses
back onto his nose with a thumb
and forefinger. "By Caesar," he
said.</p>
<p>Ross ran a hefty paw back
through his red crew cut and
twisted his face into a mock grimace.
"Well," he said, "I have to
revise my former statement. I used
brute strength against Crowley, the
doctor used sweet reason, and Pat
her womanly wiles. And all failed.
But as biochemists, each working
without the knowledge of the
others, we used science—and it paid
off. I suppose the thing to do now
is buy three jet tickets for California."</p>
<p>Braun and Patricia looked at him
blankly.</p>
<p>Ross explained. "Didn't you hear
what Crowley said? His brother,
Donald, has moved out to San
Francisco. He's our real Common
Man, we'll have to start the
experiment all over again."</p>
<p>Dr. Braun snorted.</p>
<p>Patricia O'Gara, hands on hips,
snapped, "Ross Wooley, our engagement
is off!"</p>
